    <p style="font-family:cursive;color:white">
        It's been a long time since we knew each other. A lot has happened, but we're still here. 
        This shows how much I love you and how I value the best girl in my life. 
        My life before you were really different, and I never want to go back to that version of me, 
        thanks to you, my love. You changed a lot in me, and I never regret knowing and loving you. 
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:cursive;color:white">
        Having you is like something I look forward whenever I wake up. 
        You've brought me so much happiness that I don't even remember my problems. 
        Even were far apart, I feel very close to you, Lorrainne. 
        I want to hold you, kiss you, hug you, and everything we talk about that we want to do. 
        You are already part of me and I know I could never be complete without you.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:cursive;color:white">
        We will be together, Lorrainne. Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe and to love you. 
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:cursive;color:white;">
        I love you, my Cherie Amour.
